    "Compyrtment is a Python library for compartment models. These are simple models often use to describe processes such as epidemic spread (e.g. the SIR model) or population ecology (the Lotka-Volterra model). At their essence, these models consist of two things:\n",

    "The way you would represent this model in Compyrtment is by defining a model with a given set of states, then adding couplings. The couplings are added with the method `.set_coupling_rate` and using a descriptor string in the format:\n",

    "which means a quadratic coupling using the states A and B, moving population from C to D. This means the coupling would appear with a minus sign in $dC/dt$, and a positive one in $dD/dt$, thus leading to a constant overall population - the population simply shifts from one side to the other. Terms in the above string can be omitted, leading to intuitive outcomes. For example, `A:C=>D` will produce a linear coupling proportional only to A. `A*B` will produce a quadratic coupling that shifts members from A to B. `:=>D` will produce a constant term that only grows D without reducing anything, and thus constituting a 'source', which increases the total population.\n",
