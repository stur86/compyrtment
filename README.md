# Compyrtment

A simple Python library for compartment models.

## Getting started

Download the library from Github, either cloning it:

    git clone https://github.com/stur86/compyrtment.git 

or downloading the raw archive and unzipping it. Once it's downloaded, in the folder above, run the following command:

    pip install ./compyrtment

and you're ready to use it. If you're on Windows, the suggestion is to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and perform the operations above within its environment.
